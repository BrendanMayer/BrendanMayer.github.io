  <p><em>Climb The Ladder</em> is my final‑year project: an office‑set prototype where you talk to co‑workers to get promoted.
  NPCs respond with <strong>procedurally generated dialogue</strong> powered by ChatGPT, and you can speak your lines using <strong>Whisper</strong> for voice recognition.</p>

  <h2>Why this project?</h2>
  <p>I’ve been fascinated by AI‑driven NPCs since seeing Tamulur’s 2023 video showcasing ChatGPT characters in a VR tavern.
  Another inspiration was the indie game <em>Suck Up!</em>, where AI‑generated conversations drive the gameplay loop.
  I wanted to explore how far that idea could go in a small, focused prototype.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>The project uses a Unity–OpenAI bridge (HTTPS requests) to talk to ChatGPT and Whisper. The main challenge was giving ChatGPT
  enough <strong>context</strong> to speak as a specific character in a live game world.</p>

  <p>To solve that, I built a <strong>personality system</strong> with Scriptable Objects—name, job title, interests, dislikes, and more.
  Each NPC receives a short “loading message” before the first line, seeded with this data plus current game state.</p>

  <p>The <strong>task system</strong> feeds completed tasks into the conversation context too, so characters can refer to what you’ve done.
  Voice input is recorded, transcribed by Whisper, then sent as text to ChatGPT for a response.</p>

  <h2>State machines</h2>
  <p>Player and NPC behaviour runs on <strong>finite state machines</strong> for clarity and performance. States gate actions—e.g. the
  player can’t interact while airborne—so scripts only run when relevant.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>Reliable real‑time integration between transcription and chat required a lot of iteration. I settled on a lightweight model for
  quick responses and kept interactions one‑to‑one to control API load.</p>

  <h2>Current status</h2>
  <p>The prototype supports natural conversations with multiple NPCs, with scalable instances and manageable request volume.
  At the time of writing, most core systems are in place; I’ll update this post after submission.</p>

  <h2>Future work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A small <strong>skill system</strong> to unlock social perks and difficulty modifiers.</li>
    <li>Integrate my 3D <strong>procedural office generator</strong> for replayable layouts.</li>
  </ul>

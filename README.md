# Developer Blog & Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer blog and portfolio website forked from the Github Pages Game Dev Neon Theme. The site is used to document projects, prototypes, and tools I have built, with a focus on sharing technical breakdowns, workflows, and lessons learned during development.

The website serves both as a public portfolio and as a long-form archive of development write-ups.
